# My Startup App - RecipeFinder
Startup Project for CS 260 - Web Programming

## This is My First Section
I added this on github

## Specs
I need an interface that will be able to query recipes from sources on the internet using keywords like cuisines, dietary restrictions, etc., or exact dish names. There also needs to be a way to search by ingredients, and either limit it to only those ingredients or have it include at least some or all of them.
There should be a seamless way to save visited recipes, auto-organize them by different keywords, and also create personal categories, which can be shared with friends

## Notes
 - ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@recipefinder.click
 - Caddy enables us to get free https certificates.

 - check my css flex codepen for a basic outline for what my app could look like. Refer to there for a review of how flex works. Also remember vh and vw are view height and width.

## Ideas
what if, instead, I did an app that can scrape a pdf and change the font, do a speedreading thing where it just flashes each word individually rapidly, MAYBE reads it out loud, stores the text in a more efficient format, etc.
