# My Startup App
Startup Project for CS 260 - Web Programming

## This is My First Section
I added this in my IDE
I added this on github
I'm pretty familiar with github so this wasn't anything new for me.

## Specs
I need an interface that will be able to query recipes from sources on the internet using keywords like cuisines, dietary restrictions, etc., or exact dish names. There also needs to be a way to search by ingredients, and either limit it to only those ingredients or have it include at least some or all of them.
There should be a seamless way to save visited recipes, auto-organize them by different keywords, and also create personal categories, which can be shared with friends

## Notes
 - ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@recipefinder.click
 - Caddy enables us to get free https certificates.
 - If I pass a .sh script through a Windows editor, sometimes it will use the wrong endline character and bash won't work (it says "$/r" command not found.)
 - check my css flex codepen for a basic outline for what my app could look like. Refer to there for a review of how flex works. Also remember vh and vw are view height and width.

 - It's important to remember with flex that the flex-direction is talking about how the *elements* are arranged, not the content inside them, so with row, the elements will look like they are each a column, because they will be arranged *in a row*.

 - I also need to remember that bootstrap handles color schemes really well, and I should enable dark and light mode by defining the theme in one place so I can toggle it.
