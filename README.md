# My Startup App
Startup Project for CS 260 - Web Programming

## This is My First Section
I added this in my IDE
I added this on github
I'm pretty familiar with github so this wasn't anything new for me.

## Specs
I need an interface that will be able to query recipes from sources on the internet using keywords like cuisines, dietary restrictions, etc., or exact dish names. There also needs to be a way to search by ingredients, and either limit it to only those ingredients or have it include at least some or all of them.
There should be a seamless way to save visited recipes, auto-organize them by different keywords, and also create personal categories, which can be shared with friends

## Notes
ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@recipefinder.click
Caddy enables us to get free https certificates.
